<h3>Pictures</h3>

<p>
  Here are a few pictures of some of the things I work on and some of the things I enjoy.

<em>PS T9 testbeam facility at CERN in June 2011.  This testbeam was used to test fast (slink) readout of our system, test our luminosity DAQ, and measure charge collection and hit efficiencies.</em>

<em>Me standing next to the H2 magnet at the SPS testbeam facility at CERN.  This magnet was ramped to 3T to test the response of our detector and electronics in full readout mode in a high magnetic field.  July 2011</em>

<em>The PLT test setup inside the H2 magnet at the CERN SPS testbeam facility in July 2011.  We ramped the magnet from 0 to 3T and back over the course of several hours while continuously reading out the detector.  The detector performed as designed for operation in a high magnetic field.</em>

<em>Me with the pilot PLT detector, fully installed, but before the HF platform was brought back up to beam level.  February 2012.</em>

<em>The pilot PLT just after installation in January 2012.  There are 4 diamond telescopes places symmetrically around the beampipe and one silicon telescope at 12 o'clock for diagnostic testing and systematic studies.  This detector was operational throughout the 2012 and 2013 LHC running.  This is the first detector of its kind to be built and installed in the LHC.</em>

<em>Me in the CMS cavern after the PLT pilot detector was installed in the HF garage.  Here we did some source testing to make sure all sensors were working properly before the platform was brought up to beam level.  January 2012.</em>

<em>Sometimes precautions are necessary.  This is me in June 2012 when we were replacing 3 diamonds from the pilot installation which allowed us to study some removed sensors in the lab and at other testbeams.</em>

<em>Me in the CMS cavern standing below the service shaft in June 2012.  We replaced 3 of the diamond sensors after 7/fb to study in the lab and in several testbeams.</em>
